# prawn-js

## Overview

This extension to the Prawn PDF generation library adds support for embedding javascript
in your files. These Javascript fragments will be compiled and executed on supported
viewers (like Adobe Acrobat Reader), usually in response to particular events (like the
document opening, closing, etc).

The Javascript syntax supported is fairly standard, although it includes a few extensions
defined by Adobe. For more information on these extensions (and the capabilities of
Javascript and PDF in general) visit Adobe's reference site, linked in the further reading
section of this readme.

## Installation

    gem install prawn-js

## Usage

Still to come.

## Licensing

This library is distributed under the terms of the MIT License. See the included file for
more detail.

## Contributing

All suggestions and patches welcome, preferably via a git repository I can pull from.
To be honest, I'm not really expecting any, this is a niche library.
